<p>In the wake of tumultuous events, frustration and energy must be converted into action!
Eventually the Great Depression ceased, and after that the Great War (WW II).  Action
brings closure.</p>

<p>We have pondered various courses of action, followed discussions, and weighed alternatives
for a number of years.  We have had direct conversations with victims, Second Amendment
advocates, etc.</p>

<p>Suggestions:</p>

<div class="w3-accordion w3-light-grey">
  <button onclick="myFunction('Demo3')" class="w3-btn-block w3-left-align w3-red">
    Understand the Second Amendment...
  </button>
  <div id="Demo3" class="w3-accordion-content w3-container">
<p>The brief and perhaps purposely somewhat vaguely worded amendment does succeed in
convincing us that we all have basic "KABA" rights (as we call it).  The most striking
phrase "Keep and Bear Arms".  Something never to be infringed.</p>
    <p>Perhaps a side anecdote will help to explain this.  During our interviews we indirectly
encountered a fellow (we'll call him "Popeye" here).  He felt so strongly about this
amendment that he had it tattooed onto his arm!  (Including the KABA phrase).
He seems to have made a subliminal message saying two things at once: he
has a right to "keep and bare his arm" (never to be denied, as we all agree).
So, it follows, that he has another never to be denied right to "keep and bear arms".
In Popeye's opinion it is inconceivable that either of these two "rights" could ever be
 denied, infringed or otherwise taken away!</p>

    Advocate for KABA rights as spelled out in the Second Amendment...
  </button>
  <div id="Demo4" class="w3-accordion-content w3-container">
    <p>First we have, as back then (1930s), a "depression" going on.  Too many folks are severely 
<p>Understand that this web site is trying its best to reincarnate the defunct
National Recovery Administration with a "Newer Deal" mission: foster acceptance
of a vital (KABA) right but, at the same time, foster the legacy NRA attitude:
 "we do our part" so that the amendment's vision can be acceptable to all.</p>

  <button onclick="myFunction('Demo5')" class="w3-btn-block w3-left-align w3-red">
    Implement a non-governmental volunteer organization whose members are
law-abiding gun owners...
  </button>
  <div id="Demo5" class="w3-accordion-content w3-container">
    <p>Collogistics has embarked on designing and implementing a new organization that
consists of gun owners and other associated volunteers.  The model used
employs the "we do our part" philosophy.  To understand this model Collogistics
has also created a "Parlor Presentation" for educating folks about the unique
approach being developed as we speak.  To schedule a viewing and discussion
(groups of twelve or smaller) contact nra@collogistics.com.</p>
